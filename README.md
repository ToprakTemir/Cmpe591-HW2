 # Cmpe591 Deep Learning for Robotics Project 1: 


# How to run:

HW2.py is the actual implementation of the homework, homework2.py is just the environment file. 

An example of creating a DQN, optionally loading already trained model, creating environment and plotting rewards is given in the __main__ block of the HW2.py.

train() function in the DQNAgent class automatically creates the necessary environment and trains a new model. test() function creates the environment in GUI mode and runs the trained model.
